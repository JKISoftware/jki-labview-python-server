Together with its distribution to you of the JKI Product, JKI may make some Third Party Software available to you via download or other distribution.   In addition, following your installation of the JKI Product, the JKI Product may be able to, based on your instruction, connect to the internet and identify additional Third Party Software for download and installation on your computer on your behalf.
